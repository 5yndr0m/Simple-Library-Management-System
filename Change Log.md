<p>Initially planned to use 2 panels inside the Dashboard.cs to contain buttons and content that linked to each button.
  There will be 2 user controls one panel containing a navigation panel for staff and one for users. Also, the content panel
  has 10+ user controls. We decided to follow this process to reduce the number of forms and increase the code reusability.
  However, we faced some technical difficulties in implementing our structure. <i>Issues being: </i><b> Not being able to properly 
  link a button inside a user control to perform a task inside a form.</b> Due to the above technical difficulty, after a team discussion,
  we decided to use seperate forms with navigation panels integrated into them for staff and users. We are still fixed with the idea of
  using user controls for the content panel.</p>
